owner reviews


Sure, I can help you outline a roadmap for your React Native app using Expo. Here's a high-level overview of the steps and components you might consider:

1. First Page (Home Page):
Two options:
Give Review
See Review
On selecting "Give Review," navigate to the second page.
On selecting "See Review," navigate to the fourth page.




2. Second Page (Select Society using Map):
Use Google Maps integration.
Add a search bar connected to Google Maps API to find the society name.
Once society is selected, navigate to the third page.



3. Third Page (Add Owner Name and Review):
Option to add owner name.
Check if the owner name already exists.
If it exists, skip to the review section.
If it doesn't, add owner details (name) and then proceed to the review section.
Add a text input for the review.
Submit the review and store the data in the database (society_name, owner_name, review).
Redirect to the home page or show a success message.



4. Fourth Page (View Reviews):
Search for society name using Google Maps.
Display a list of owners and their reviews for the selected society.
If no reviews, show a "Sorry, no reviews available" message.
Provide an option to search by owner name.
On selecting an owner, show their reviews.
Additional Considerations:
Navigation:

Use a navigation library (e.g., React Navigation) for smooth page transitions.
Handle back navigation appropriately.

State Management:

Consider using React Context or Redux for state management, especially for passing data between pages.
Database:

Set up a backend service with a database (Firebase, MongoDB, etc.) to store and retrieve data.
API Integration:

Integrate Google Maps API for location-based features.
Styling:

Use a styling library like Styled Components or CSS-in-JS for consistent styling.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling for network requests and user input validation.
Testing:

Test your app on both iOS and Android devices to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
Deployment:

Deploy your app using Expo to share it with others or publish it on app stores.
This is a basic roadmap, and you may need to adjust it based on the specific requirements and features you want to include in your app. Make sure to handle edge cases, error scenarios, and user feedback for a robust user experience.
